## 📚 About the project

This project was developed during the Groupie Tracker project, by Ynov Campus. The goal was to create a website and using Go templates to interact with APIs

We decided to add some features to the site, such as:
- 🎶 A Spotify integration
- 🗺️ A map to show the location of the concerts
- 📍 A geocode cache system

The final project repository can be founded [here](https://ytrack.learn.ynov.com/git/lalucas/groupie-tracker.git)
